Be sure to update the submodule first

autoconf doesnt come bundled with OS X, so you need to install them separatly. I don't want to maintain a separate xcode project :( Using Homebrew its easy though:

Install Homebrew with:
# ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

Then automake with friends:
# brew install automake
Its funny how a compile script needs another compile script :)

if you want to pick up the system scripts from the $topsrcdir/data/ use --enable-developer-build
