Be sure to update the submodule first

build_shell uses cmake to build. For quick and dirty way to try out build_shell
make a directory in the root build_shell directory. Then move to that directory
and execute

$ cmake ..

build_shell builds in developer mode if no prefix is specified. developer mode
means that it will not be possible to run the make install rule, and paths are
hardcoded to point to the build and src directories. To be able to use
build_shell move to the build directory then source the file in
data/build_shell/build_shell_completion.bash

This will add both the path for jsonmod and build_shell build directories to
the path. build_shell has also been built to look for build scripts in the
build_shell src directory .ie. $build_shell_src_dir/data/build_shell/scripts

If a install prefix has been specified, then the prefix for the binary has to
be set in the path, and the build_shel_completion.bash file has to be source
from the installation location. Also note then that build_shell will look for
build_scripts in the installation location
